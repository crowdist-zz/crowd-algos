# AI-algorithms
A selection of well-known AI and machine learning algorithms, implemented in Java. The code is very domain-agnostic, so it can be adapted for many tasks. The goal is to create a lightweight library for quick prototyping and simple production applications. If you *really* have a lot of data, you should use [Apache Mahout](https://mahout.apache.org/).

Many of the ML algorithms were taken from the great bible of [Machine Learning - Tom M. Mitchell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/mlbook.html)

## Usage
To see an example of how to use the library, take a look at the unit tests. One or more applications are included for each one.
